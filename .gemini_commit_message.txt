refactor: Rename "Gemini CLI" to "Go AI Agent"

Renamed all occurrences of "Gemini CLI" to "Go AI Agent" across the codebase.
This includes:
- Updating Go code (variables, strings, comments) in `cmd/*.go`,
  `pkg/extension/manager.go`, `pkg/commands/extensions.go`,
  `pkg/core/gemini.go`, and `pkg/core/mock_executor.go`.
- Updating documentation and markdown files (`PLAN.md`, `PROMPT.md`,
  `README.md`, `REVIEW.md`, `agent.md`, `docs/privacy_notice.md`).
- Ensured that `docs/gemini-cli-main` was not renamed as per user's request.
- Verified that all changes compile and tests pass.
