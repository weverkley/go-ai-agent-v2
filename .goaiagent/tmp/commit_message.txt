fix: Resolve chat command recognition and type consistency issues

This commit addresses several issues to enable proper command recognition within the chat UI and ensure type consistency across the application:

- **pkg/ui/chat_ui.go**:
    - Integrated Cobra's command handling into `handleSlashCommand` to correctly parse and execute CLI commands from user input.
    - Added `rootCmd *cobra.Command` field to `ChatModel` and updated `NewChatModel` to accept and initialize it.
    - Added `io` and `os` imports for command execution.
    - Corrected a syntax error in the `lipgloss.NewStyle()` call.
- **cmd/chat.go**:
    - Updated the call to `ui.NewChatModel` to pass the `RootCmd` instance.
- **pkg/core/executor_factory.go**:
    - Modified `ExecutorFactory` interface and its implementations (`GeminiExecutorFactory`, `MockExecutorFactory`) to accept `types.Config` instead of `*config.Config` for the `NewExecutor` method.
    - Removed and re-added the `config` import as needed.
- **pkg/core/mock_executor_test.go**:
    - Added the `WithModel` method to `MockConfig` to ensure it fully implements `types.Config`.
    - Added the `routing` import.
    - Updated calls to `core.NewExecutorFactory` to pass `&MockConfig{}`.
    - Updated `TestGeminiExecutorFactory_NewExecutor` to pass `&MockConfig{}` to `routing.NewModelRouterService`.
- **pkg/routing/router.go**:
    - Modified `NewModelRouterService` and `ModelRouterService.Route` to accept `types.Config`.
    - Modified `CompositeStrategy.Route` to accept `types.Config`.
    - Removed and re-added the `config` import as needed.
- **pkg/routing/strategy.go**:
    - Modified the `RoutingStrategy` interface and its implementations (`DefaultStrategy`, `OverrideStrategy`, `FallbackStrategy`) to accept `types.Config`.
    - Removed and re-added the `config` import as needed.
- **pkg/ui/chat_ui_test.go**:
    - Added `cobra` import.
    - Updated all calls to `NewChatModel` to pass a dummy `*cobra.Command` instance.

These changes collectively fix the chat command recognition, resolve type mismatches, and ensure all tests pass.
