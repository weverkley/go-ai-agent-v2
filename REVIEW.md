I want you to read the content of my docs/gemini-cli-main, IMPORTANT, ignore and test prefixed or sufixed file, ignore markdown files, as its a big project there are so many files, focus on the main functionality and map its flow of execution.

This is an interactive TUI which interacts with gemini api, it can act as a agent which builds a full project based on a single prompt.

Theres a README.md file inside that you can read to have more context.

After learning about the execution and the core files involved on the workflow, i want you to validate my golang port of this application and validate its functionality, it must have the same behaviour, strucuted prompt for calling tools and etc.

I want to input a prompt for this go application and from the basic to the complex project it will execute, create files and give me a working project.

**Important** focus on the prompt structure to generate the json output and the tools calling.
