I want you to read the content of my docs/go-ai-agent-main, IMPORTANT, ignore any test prefixed or sufixed file, ignore markdown files, as its a big project there are so many files, focus on the main functionality and map its flow of execution.
In the folder docs/go-ai-agent-main, there is an interactive TUI which interacts with gemini api, it can act as a agent which builds a full project based on a single prompt.

In the root directory of this project there is a README.md file that you can read to have more context.

After learning about the execution and the core files involved on the workflow, i want you to validate my golang port of this application and validate its functionality, it must have the same behaviour, strucuted prompt for calling tools and etc.

I want to input a prompt for this go application and from the basic to the complex project it will execute, create files and give me a working project.

**Important** focus on the prompt structure to generate the json output and the tools calling.
