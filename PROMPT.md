read my @go-cli/PLAN.md and continue my execution plan, after implementing each command you must test 
the command, also when creating or updating a new go file, read the source javasctipt file to address 
the logic, and make sure the same logic is applied, it must have the same responses and behaviour

I have stopped implementing executor.go, you can continue by implementing it

i want to replicate the same GUI for the cli which the javascript version already have
